# Hardhat DeFi and Aave
- The aave protocol treats everything as an ERC20 token
- ETH isn't an ERC20 token, but WETH(Wrapped ETH) is

# Mainnet Forking
> Another way to run tests is to fork the mainnet, and run a local 
  Hardhat node pretending to be a mainnet node
> NOTE:- forking doesn't download the entire blockchain, instead when we 
  reference an address, we make api call to ethereum node(alchemy here), and
  will return just that specific contract
> Hardhat mainnet forking also provides fake accounts

# Overall steps in short 
- eth to weth 
- mainnet fork 
- getting lending pool contract 
- approving and depositing in lending pool
