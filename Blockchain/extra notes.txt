Deploying to a testnet or mainnet:-
- we simply need the testnet RPC URL and the account's private key for it
- for this, we can use geth(go-eth)
- here, we will use a 3rd party whcih provides blockchain node as a service - alchemy
- other options can be - infura, quicknode, moralis

- create an app in alchemy with goerli network and copy the https key and paste in rpc_url in .env
- get private key from your metamask and paste in private_key in .env
