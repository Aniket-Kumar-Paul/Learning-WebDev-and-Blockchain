# checked and unchecked
- before v0.8.0, unchecked was set by default, which means
    uint8 public bigNumber = 255; // for 8bits, 255 is max
    bigNumber = bigNumber+1; // will set bigNumber to 0(lowest number for uint8) as overflow occurs
- but after v0.8.0, default is checked, which means it will give an error if overflow occurs
- we can still make something unchecked,
    Eg: unchecked {bigNumber = bigNumber+1;}
