# Hardhat DeFi and Aave
- The aave protocol treats everything as an ERC20 token
- ETH isn't an ERC20 token, but WETH(Wrapped ETH) is
- aave health factor < 1 => gets liquidated
> NOTE:- When we deposit our collateral, we get back an aToken (interest bearing token),
        which keeps track of how much collateral(Eg. WETH token) we have deposited in aave protocol.
        When we want to withdraw the collateral back, we burn/remove the aTokens.

# Mainnet Forking
> Another way to run tests is to fork the mainnet, and run a local 
  Hardhat node pretending to be a mainnet node
> NOTE:- forking doesn't download the entire blockchain, instead when we 
  reference an address, we make api call to ethereum node(alchemy here), and
  will return just that specific contract
> Hardhat mainnet forking also provides fake accounts

# Overall steps in short 
- eth to weth 
- mainnet fork 
- getting lending pool contract 
- approving and depositing in lending pool 
- getting borrow user data
- getting dai(token to borrow) price
- borrowing dai 
- repaying dai
