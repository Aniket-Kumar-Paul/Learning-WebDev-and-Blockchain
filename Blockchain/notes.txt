-> Using rinkeby testnet (faucet.rinkeby.io) for testing.
 
# Gas:
-> Gas is a unit of computational measure. The more computation a transaction uses the more "gas" you have to pay for.
-> Every transaction that happens on-chain pays a "gas fee" to node operators.

> Gas Price: How much it costs per unit of gas (based off the "demand" of the blockchain)
> Gas Limit: Max amount of gas allowed in a transaction

> Transaction Fee: Gas Used x Gas Price
i.e 21000 gas @ 1 GWEI per gas = 21000 GWEI

# Genesis Block: The first block in blockchain

# Block: A list of transactions mined together

# Nonce: "number used once"-> to find the solution to the blockchain problem.
			   -> it's also used to define the transaction number for an account/address.



# Consensus :- 
-> Mechanism used to agree on the state of a blockchain
-> In regards to blockchain, reaching consensus means that at least 51% of the nodes on the network agree on the next global state of the network.
-> It's the *Sybil resistance* mechanism combined with a *chain selection* rule that makes up a true consensus mechanism.
-> Mechanisms :
	1) Proof of Work
	2) Proof of Stake
	3) Proof of Authority
-> Nakamoto Consensus = Proof of work + Longest Chain Rule
-> Attacks - 1) Sybil Attack
	     2) 51% Attack


# Sharding :-
-> solution to scalability problem
	[scalability problem -> more people use blockchain => more gas fees they have to pay]
-> blockchains of a blockchain
-> increases the no. of transactions in layer 1
	[layer 1: Base layer blockchain implementation
		  Eg: Bitcoin, Ethereum etc.]
	[layer 2: appliacation added on top of layer 1
		  Eg: chainlink, arbitrum, optimism etc.]
       #[Arbitrum and Optimism also look to solve scalability issues. They are called Rollups as they rollup their transaction to layer 1]



# Transactions
|_ Nonce
|_ Gas Price
|_ Gas Limit
|_ To
|_ Value
|_ Data
|_ v, r, s (components of tx signature)

- Tx-Contract Deployment
> To: empty
> Data: contract init code & contract bytecode

- Tx-Function Call
> To: address that the tx is sent to
> Data: what to send to the To address

- we can directly set these values by using .call method
	Eg: winner.call{value: address(this).balance}("") --> ("") is the call data
	- {} -> pass specific field of tx, like value
	- () -> pass data in order to call a specific function
		|_ To call a function using only data field of call, we need to encode to binary level following:
		|	|_ function name & parameters we want to add
		|_ how to do this ?

	- since, here we just send ETH so we don't call any function in ("")
