> governance_standard -> all voting logic that the governance token is going to use
    > TimeLock is an additional contract that is actually the owner of the Box contract

> The GovernorContract is where we're gonna send our votes and stuff, but its the TimeLock
 that everything needs to flow through in order for the governance to actually happen

> setup governance contract 
    - we wanna only allow the proposers in the timelock contract to be the governor
    - the governor contract should be the only one that proposes things to the timelock

    - In other words, the governance contract proposes something to the time lock.
     once it's in the time lock, and it waits that period, anybody can go and execute it.

> Also, we need the deploy script for the contract(Box.sol) that we actually want to govern over
