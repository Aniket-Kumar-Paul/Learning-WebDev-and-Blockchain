> alchemy - web3 development tools to build & scale dApps
	|_ getting rpc urls
> chainlink/contracts - several tools, data feeds(getting price etc.)

> solhint - solidity linting
> mocking - creating a second version of that contract which behaves very similar to the original one, but in a way that can be easily controlled by the developer.
	|_ can create using inheritance etc
> mocha - JavaScript test framework running on Node.js and in the browser, making asynchronous testing simple and fun.

	|_ working with multiple chains and addresses
> hardhat-shorthand - lesser typings for commands to compile etc..
