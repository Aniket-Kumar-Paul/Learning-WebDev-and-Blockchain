> alchemy - web3 development tools to build & scale dApps
	|_ getting rpc urls
> chainlink/contracts - several tools, data feeds(getting price etc.)
> hardhat - ethereum development environment
> solhint - solidity linting
> mocking - creating a second version of that contract which behaves very similar to the original one, but in a way that can be easily controlled by the developer.
	|_ can create using inheritance etc
> mocha - JavaScript test framework running on Node.js and in the browser, making asynchronous testing simple and fun.
> chaijs - for writing tests
> aave -  decentralized non-custodial liquidity markets protocol where users can participate as suppliers or borrowers.
	|_ working with multiple chains and addresses
> hardhat-shorthand - lesser typings for commands to compile etc..
> react-moralis - Moralis is a cross-chain solution meaning that the dApp can easily be ported to many other EVM compatible chains. we can use it in place of ethersjs.
